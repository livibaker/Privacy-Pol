Personal information shall not be collected by any agency unless â€“
(a) the information is collected for a lawful purpose connected with a function or activity of the agency; and
(b) the collection of the information is necessary for that purpose.
Agencies need to carefully consider the purpose for which they collect personal information. If an agency defines its purpose too narrowly, it may be unable to use information in the way that it wants to in the future. But, if its purposes are too broad, they risk becoming meaningless - the agency could be collecting information it has no real need for and people could be confused.

Having a clearly defined purpose will make it much easier for an agency to respond to its obligations under the other principles of the Act.

Checklist Questions: 
1)	Do I have a lawful purpose for collecting this information?
2) Is that purpose connected with one of my agency's functions or activities?
